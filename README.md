# Healthcare_Project
This repository contains a total of seven files for the Healthcare Project. The goal of this project is to address key questions related to organizational profit, costs, claims, procedures, patients, and insurance. A detailed description of each file and aspect of the project is provided below.

* Healthcare Project - Data and Transformation

Four datasets are loaded for this project: claims, patients, providers, and procedures. The data has been cleaned by checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Outliers are identified using the z-score method, and a histogram and Q-Q plot are presented to better visualize the distribution of the data. Additionally, the Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to detect outliers, which are represented using a boxplot.

All four dataframes are merged to facilitate more convenient future analysis.

* Healthcare Project - Claim Approval

In this project, a predictive model (logistic regression) is built to predict whether a claim is approved (1) or not approved (0) based on three features: claim amount, patient's age, and provider.

The data used for the model comes from the merged datasets described in the previous section. A logistic regression model was created, and a classification report was generated to assess how well the model performs.

For visualization, a confusion matrix was presented to evaluate the model's accuracy, a feature importance graph was used to show the relative importance of each feature, and an ROC curve was plotted to assess the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (Recall) and the False Positive Rate. Additionally, a Precision-Recall curve was created to provide a better understanding of the model's performance with imbalanced classes.

The model was used to predict whether a patient’s claim would be approved based on a claim amount of $2,500, the patient being 65 years old, and the provider being PVR003.

* Healthcare Project - Patient Readmission

In this project, two predictive models —Logistic Regression and Decision Tree— are built to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The prediction is based on three key features: age, insurance provider, and procedure cost.

A classification report was generated to evaluate the performance of both models.

For visualization, a confusion matrix was presented to assess the models' accuracy. A feature importance graph was used to show the relative importance of each feature, and an ROC curve was plotted to evaluate the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (Recall) and the False Positive Rate. Additionally, a Precision-Recall curve was created to better understand the models' performance with imbalanced classes.

In the Decision Tree model, a Decision Tree plot was also provided to visually represent the tree’s structure. This helps in understanding how the model makes predictions and how the data is split at each node.

* Healthcare Project - Profitability of Various Procedures

The total revenue generated by each procedure is calculated and its profitability assessed by comparing the revenue to the associated costs. This analysis helps identify the most financially efficient procedures, prioritize high-margin services, and pinpoint areas that may require cost optimization or reevaluation.

For visualization, a plot representing the profitability of different procedures was created.

* Healthcare Project - Time Series - Claim Volume

Time series analysis is used to forecast monthly claims for the next 12 months. A log transformation was applied to stabilize the variance and make growth patterns in the data easier to model and forecast accurately. Exponential Smoothing was used for forecasting the monthly claims.

For visualization, a plot was created to show the historical data alongside the forecasted values. Additionally, a detailed summary of the model's performance, statistical significance, and fit quality was provided.

* Healthcare Project - Questions

In this project, we aim to answer eight key questions related to various issues that will help improve our business and inform important decisions.

Question 1: How are insurance claim reimbursements trending over time, and are delays or denials impacting cash flow? To evaluate the efficiency of the claims process, identify potential issues with payer contracts, and improve cash flow management.

Question 2: What is the return on investment (ROI) for various treatments, procedures, and medical technologies? To assess whether the organization’s investment in specific treatments or technologies is generating adequate financial returns.

Question 3: What are the average patient acquisition costs, and how do they compare with the patient lifetime value? To assess the balance between the costs of acquiring new patients and the long-term revenue each patient generates, helping to optimize marketing and operational strategies.

Question 4: How much time are our doctors and medical staff spending on direct patient care compared to administrative tasks, and how can we optimize labor efficiency? To evaluate workforce productivity, identify inefficiencies, and ensure that medical staff spend the maximum amount of time on revenue-generating activities.

Question 5: What are the main insurance provider with denied claims and how many are they? To identify the insurance provider with the more amount in dollars for denial claims.

Question 6: Which patient demographics (such as age, location, insurance type, etc.) are driving the highest costs and revenues for the organization? To identify which patient populations are the most profitable or costly, and to adjust services, marketing, and care management strategies accordingly.

Question 7: How do our financial performance metrics (e.g., profit margin, cost per procedure, payer mix) compare to industry benchmarks and competitors? To evaluate the organization's performance relative to the market, identifying areas for improvement and potential competitive advantages.

Question 8: What are the trends in patient readmission rates across different medical procedures? To identify which medical procedures are associated with higher readmission rates within 30 days of discharge.

* Healthcare Project - Dashboard

Dashboard is created in Power BI, emphasizes profit, revenue, costs, and claims for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The insurance providers act as button filters for all the graphs.

In the first graph, the profit per procedure is represented, with tooltips showing the profit margin and ROI. The second graph displays the total number of claims by year, along with the approved claims. The last two graphs are time series plots: the first shows revenue and costs for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, while the second focuses on the year 2024, broken down by month
